Tips:

You can use any type of pork you like for this recipe. I like to use pork shoulder because it's flavorful and tender.
If you don't have smoked sausage, you can use any type of sausage you like. I like to use kielbasa or chorizo.
You can adjust the amount of paprika and cayenne pepper to your taste.
If you don't have a cornmeal, you can use polenta.
You can serve the Tochitura with a side of your favorite vegetables.
Enjoy!
